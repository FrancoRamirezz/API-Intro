## Installation Frontend ðŸ«¡
To ensure installation is done correctly, you need to type "npx Create-react-app" in your terminal. If there is an error regarding "NPM" installation, downloading NodeJs on your local computer will solve this issue. Once, you run this command in the terminal you should see files that state Public, Src - which contains the file "App.js" and "App.css". Note: to ensure this runs smoothly, cd into the directory that you used to name the app. For example, I used "create-react-app csaf-app" and then cd into it to run it. Also, the node_moldues won't be present when downloading it, so run npm install and then npm run start. Now react should be ready to start

## Installation Backend ðŸ«¡
As for the backend aspect of the project, type in the terminal "npm install firebase" and you should see it begin to download. If there is an error regarding "npm firebase", then that means you must download nodejs  on your local computer. Once that is done, you should be able to import Firebase and not get a yellow line depending on your chosen IDE. As for dependencies, for the react-router plz install "npm install react-router" and "npm install firebase and firebase-tools". Also, to ensure it runs correctly, make a firebase.js file, which contains the best method to authorize the app. Here are the links for the following. Follow them to deploy if needed
