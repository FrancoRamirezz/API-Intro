## Introduction ðŸ«¡
An API or an application programming interface is a piece of software that enables two different machines or applications to communicate with each other. The best example is to think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. The front end is what the customer sees, but to make an order, the customer must order off the menu. After that, the menu is then offered to the backend which is represented by the cooks making the meal. An API has four major components, get, post, put, and delete. 
## ApI four request methods 
GET: This is used to retrieve specific data from the API.

POST: This tells the API you want to add, or post, new data to the server. 

PUT: This is used to update existing resources on the API. 

DELETE: This is used toâ€”you guessed itâ€”delete existing data from the server. 
A transaction per second (TPS) limit is a metric used to measure the processing limits of an API

## DiscordJs or Discordpy  ðŸ«¡
Discordjs is a library that serves as a wrapper for all of Discord's functionality 
## Tokens and API
The discord token can be found on the developer portal. The Open API can be found on the developer portal as well.
