## Introduction ðŸ«¡
An API or an application programming interface is a piece of software that enables two different machines or applications to communicate with each other. The best example is to think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. The front end is what the customer sees, but in order to make an order, the customer must order off the menu. After that, the menu is then offered to the backend which is represented by the cooks making the meal. An API has four major components,get, post,put, and delete
